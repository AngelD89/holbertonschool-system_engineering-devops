1. Distributed Web Infrastructure
User Flow

User accesses www.foobar.com

DNS resolves the domain to the load balancer IP

Request goes to HAProxy

HAProxy forwards the request to one of two backend servers

Nginx passes the request to the application server

The application reads/writes data from the database

Response is returned to the user

Why Each Component Is Added

Load Balancer (HAProxy): distributes traffic and improves availability

Second Server: reduces load and avoids a single backend failure

Database Replication: improves read performance and data availability

Load Balancer Details

Algorithm: Round Robin
Requests are sent sequentially to each server.

Setup: Active-Active
Both servers handle traffic simultaneously.

Active-Passive difference: only one server is active; the other waits for failure.

Database Primary-Replica

Primary (Master): handles write operations

Replica (Slave): read-only copy of data

Application writes to Primary and may read from Replica

Issues With This Infrastructure

SPOF: load balancer and primary database

Security: no firewall, no HTTPS

Monitoring: none implemented
