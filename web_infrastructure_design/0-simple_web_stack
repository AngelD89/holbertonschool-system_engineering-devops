Simple web stack

-User Access Flow (Start Here)
-A user opens a browser and types www.foobar.com
-The browser asks DNS to resolve the domain name
-DNS returns the IP address 8.8.8.8
-The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to 8.8.8.8
-The web server (Nginx) receives the request
-Nginx forwards the request to the application server
-The application server executes the codebase
-If needed, it queries the MySQL database
-The response travels back to the user’s browser

-What is a Server?
A server is a physical or virtual machine that stores data, runs software, and responds to requests from users over a network.
What is the Role of the Domain Name?
The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-readable address that maps to an IP address, so users don’t need to remember numbers.
-What Type of DNS Record is www?
www.foobar.com uses an A record
It points directly to the IP address 8.8.8.8
-What is the Role of the Web Server (Nginx)?
Accepts HTTP/HTTPS requests
Handles static content (HTML, CSS, images)
Acts as a reverse proxy to the application server
Manages SSL/TLS
-What is the Role of the Application Server?
Runs the application logic (business rules)
Processes requests passed from Nginx
Communicates with the database
Generates dynamic responses
-What is the Role of the Database (MySQL)?
Stores persistent data
Handles CRUD operations
Ensures data consistency and integrity
-How Does the Server Communicate with the User’s Computer?
Uses HTTP or HTTPS
Runs over TCP/IP
HTTPS adds encryption using SSL/TLS
