3. Scale Up Infrastructure
Overview

This infrastructure scales the previous design by adding redundancy and separating responsibilities across dedicated servers.
The goal is to improve availability, scalability, and maintainability.

Added Elements and Reasons
1. Additional Server

-Increases system capacity
-Allows traffic and workloads to be distributed
-Reduces the impact of a single server failure

2. Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy)

-A second load balancer is added and configured as a cluster with the first one
-Removes the load balancer as a single point of failure
-Ensures continuous traffic handling if one load balancer goes down

3. Component Separation

Each major component runs on its own dedicated server:

--Web Server
*Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests
*Serves static content
*Forwards dynamic requests

--Application Server
*Executes business logic
*Processes dynamic content
*Communicates with the database

--Database Server
*Stores and manages persistent data
*Handles read and write operations

--Why this separation is added:
*Each layer can scale independently
*Better performance and resource isolation
*Easier maintenance and troubleshooting
